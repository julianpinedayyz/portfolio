          Hi there, I'm Julian, an independent product designer.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          I started my design practice to tackle a widespread issue in the startup and B2B space: complex and unappealing design. In a world where everyone's software is full of features, taste is the new competitive advantage.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Great design screams "We care!". It signals trust and competence, showing people that this same attention to detail applies to all aspects of your company.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          From small startups to enterprise companies, businesses succeed by embedding design into their DNA. These businesses inspire confidence, foster loyalty, and attract talent. They show that taste and function can not only coexist but thrive together.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          With years of experience and a diverse portfolio, I bring more than just clean design to the table. I offer practical advice on product strategy, growth, and building products that stand out in the market.
        </p>
